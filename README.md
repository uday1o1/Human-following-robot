# Human-following-robot

This is the code for a basic robot that follows you based on the data gathered from infrared and ultrasonic sensors which together work to understand where the person being tracked is.
Based on the data gathered from the sensors the robot moves accordingly, it does that by the two 12V motors attached at both sides in the back.
In order to control the direction the robot moves in, we give output to each wheel separately, this includes how long the motors is active for and in which direction does it spin.
I used the arduino IDE to write and upload the code to the arduino board.

Required Components:
1. arduino board
2. 2 x 12 V motors
3. jumper wires
4. breadboard
5. 2 x 9 V battery
6. metal chasis
7. castor wheel
8. 2 x infrared sensor
9. 1 x ultrasonic sensor

{I did not build the robot irl because my motor was damaged but have seen someone else's robot and would try to implement that myself when i get a new motor or i will just borrow it for someone, I have informed other seniors about the fault component in the previous session}
